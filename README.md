# causal-lz-p-decision-tree
To run the tree codes, ensure that the dataset, the main function corresponding to it, the tree, the hyperparameter tuning file and the testing file are in the same folder. Then run the main function. 
For example, to run the causal tree on the IRIS dataset, you will require the files Driver_IRIS.py, HyperparameterTuning.py and Testing.py along with CausalDecisionTree.py. Ensure the files are in the same folder and run the command: 
python3 Driver_IRIS.py
The folders CAUSALMETRIC-TESTING and CAUSALMETRIC-TUNING will be automatically created with the performance metrics and tuned hyperparameters respectively. Also a folfer named "trees" will be created with the trained decision tree.
